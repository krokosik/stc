[STC](https://libstc.cc) | [Help Center](https://libstc.cc/#/help)

## Getting Started

- Explore our search features at [Web STC](https://libstc.cc), or through one of the Telegram bots listed in the bio of our [channel](https://t.me/nexus_search) (not an ad, just a safety)
- [Discover](https://libstc.cc/#/help/replicate) how to set up your own STC instance, enabling you to enjoy the same search capabilities in your local environment
- Learn about [how to access large corpus](/geck) of high-quality scholarly texts using Python and [use them in AI apps](/cybrex)

## Details

In essence, STC is a search engine [Summa](https://github.com/izihawa/summa) coupled with databanks. 
These databanks reside on [IPFS](https://ipfs.tech/) in a format that allows for searching without necessitating the download of the entire dataset. 
The search engine library can function as a standalone server, an embeddable Python library (requiring no additional software!), and a WASM-compiled module that can be used in a browser.
Last way allows to embed search engine in a static site that further can be deployed over IPFS too. This is how [Web STC](https://libstc.cc) is live.

Putting everything to IPFS allows you to open STC in your browser or on your server and avoid the use of centralized servers that may lose or censor data.

## Components

- [GECK](/geck) is a Python library and Bash tool for setting up and interacting with STC programmatically
- [Cybrex AI](/cybrex) library pairs STC with AI tools such as OpenAI or free LLM for processing stored data
- [STC Hub API](https://libstc.cc/#/help/stc-hub-api) is plain API for accessing scholarly publications by their DOIs through HTTP.
- [Telegram Bot](/bot) allows users to access STC via Telegram, one of the most popular messaging platforms.
